* raincloud

  /A self-hosted file sharing cloud for you and your friends./

  [[./images/screenshot.png]]

  Your friends don't use tools like [[https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole][magic-wormhole]] and you don't want to upload private data to third party file hosters?
  You want to save a file from a computer that doesn't belong to you and forgot your USB flash drive?
  /raincloud/ solves those problems by providing a simple self-hosted file sharing platform.

  *Features*

  - No users, just password protectable dynamic HTTP routes
  - No database backend, just a flat directory structure
  - Permissions per route individually configurable via plain-text files

** Example

   Assuming you host /raincloud/ at =https://cloud.example.com= and it is configured to run on =/var/www/public= with the following directory structure:

   #+begin_example
     /var/www/public
     ├── alice
     │   ├── big_buck_bunny.mkv
     │   ├── elephants_dream.mkv
     │   ├── rc.conf
     │   └── the_daily_dweebs.mkv
     └── inbox
         ├── logo.svg
         └── rc.conf
   #+end_example

   Then the following two routes exist:

   - =https://cloud.example.com/alice=
   - =https://cloud.example.com/inbox=

   This is determined by the presence of a =rc.conf= file in subdirectories in which the individual permissions for the routes can be set.
   The configuration options can be [[#rcconf][seen below]].
   All other routes, including =http://cloud.example.com=, return =404 Not Found=.

** Installation

   Execute the following command in the repository to install the /raincloud/ module in your environment:

   : $ pip install .

** Deployment

   First set up a [[https://redis.io/][Redis]] server which will be used for server-side session caching.
   Then a WSGI server like [[https://gunicorn.org/][Gunicorn]] can be used to serve /raincloud/ for example like this:

   : $ gunicorn "raincloud:create_app(base_path='public', secret_key_path='secret_key', redis_url='redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0')"

*** NixOS

    This repository is also a [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][Nix Flake]] which provides a [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] module.
    It requres a running instance of a [[https://search.nixos.org/options?query=services.redis.servers][Redis server]].
    A minimal /raincloud/ instance can be setup for example like this:

    #+begin_src nix
      raincloud.nixosModule {
        # Redis
        services.redis.servers."raincloud" = {
          enable = true;
          databases = 1;
          user="raincloud";
        };

        # Raincloud
        services.raincloud = {
          enable = true;
          basePath = "/var/lib/raincloud";
          secretKeyPath = "/var/lib/raincloud/secret_key";
          redisUrl = "unix:/run/redis-raincloud/redis.sock";
        };
      }
    #+end_src

    All configuration options are:

    | Option          | Description                                                   | Type  | Default value              | Example                                |

    | =redisUrl=      | URL of Redis database                                         | =str= | =redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0= | =unix:/run/redis-raincloud/redis.sock= |

    | =workerTimeout= | Gunicorn worker timeout                                       | =int= | =300=                      | =360=                                  |

*** Docker

    A =Dockerfile=, based on [[https://www.alpinelinux.org/][Alpine Linux]], is available in the repository.
    You can build a local /raincloud/ image with the following command:

    : $ docker build -t raincloud:latest github.com/Deleh/raincloud

    A container of the image exposes /raincloud/ at port =8000= and uses the base directory =/var/www/raincloud=.
    Use Dockers =-p= flag to map the port on your host and =-v= flag to mount a local base directory:

    : $ docker run -p <local_port>:8000 -v <path_to_local_base_directory>:/var/www/raincloud raincloud:latest

    If you want to change the cloud name you can pass the =cloud_name= environment variable to the container:

    : $ docker run -p <local_port>:8000 -v <path_to_local_base_directory>:/var/www/raincloud -e "cloud_name=podcloud" raincloud:latest

    Similarly the environment variable =worker_timeout= can be set to increase the Gunicorn worker timeout in seconds.
    It's default value is =300=.

** Configuration

   /raincloud/ provides four configuration options which can be passed to =raincloud.create_app()=:

   - =base_path= :: Base path of the raincloud
   - =secret_key_path= :: Path to file containing Flask secret key
   - =redis_url= :: URL of redis database (default: =redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0=)
   - =cloud_name= :: Cloud name (default: =raincloud=)

   Set them for example like this:
   : >>> app = raincloud.create_app(base_path='/home/alice/public', secret_key_path='/var/lib/raincloud/secret_key', redis_url='redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0', cloud_name='raincloud')

*** =rc.conf=
    :properties:
    :custom_id: rcconf
    :end:

    A =rc.conf= file looks like the following snippet and can contain up to three configuration parameters after the =[raincloud]= section:

    #+begin_src conf
      [raincloud]

      # Insert a password hash to enable password protection for this directory
      # Use one of the following commands to create a hash:
      #   mkpasswd -m sha-256
      #   mkpasswd -m sha-512
      #
      #hashed_password =

      # Set this to 'true' to allow file downloads from this directory
      download = false

      # Set this to 'true' to allow file uploads to this directory
      upload = false
    #+end_src

** Troubleshooting

   The filesize which can be uploaded may be limited by your web server.
   When using /Nginx/ for example, the following configuration parameter can be used to increase the upload files size or don't restrict it at all:

   : client_max_body_size 100M;
   : client_max_body_size 0;

   Similarly the maximum download file size can be disabled with:

   : proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;

   A network timeout may also be issued by a WSGI server.
   With Gunicorn for example the timeout can be increased with the =--timeout= argument.

   Are you getting internal server errors?
   Check the directory permissions.
   The user which runs /raincloud/ must have at least =read= permissions to allow downloads and =execute= permissions to allow uploads.
